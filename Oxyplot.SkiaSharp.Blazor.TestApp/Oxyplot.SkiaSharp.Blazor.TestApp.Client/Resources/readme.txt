Note: in order to use a non-default font in SkiaSharp,
embed it in the app. For example, to use "OpenSans", find
OpenSans-Regular.ttf, OpenSans-Bold.ttf, etc. somewhere
on the world wide web, and embed them in your Blazor app
as embedded resources. OxyPlot.SkiaSharp will then be able
to find and load them.
In order to not have issues with licensing and copyright,
no fonts are distributed with these sources.
